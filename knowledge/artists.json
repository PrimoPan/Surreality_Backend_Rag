We used body to imitate the ancient oracle bone scripts to form a dataset for training the AI model. The AI-generated Hlieroglyphs were compiled into an archive. These intuitive, cross-linguistic, cross-cultural signs—akin to emojis—aim to expand our capacity to conceptualize, understand, and communicate bodily and inter-bodily experiences.

By leveraging AI generative tools and AI-assisted techniques, the project explores the limitless possibilities of technology to enhance human imagination and offers audiences immersive experiences that merge science, art, and technology.\n\nUranus, with its unique features and mysterious nature, serves as the perfect canvas for this exploration. The planet’s ethereal beauty and unexplored qualities inspire a surrealistic reinterpretation that combines its physical characteristics with imagined life forms, creating dreamlike scenes that captivate the senses. Through AI tools, the project introduces a new way of visualizing not just the planet itself, but the potential life forms and environments that might inhabit it, exploring how AI can help bring abstract concepts into reality.\n\nKey to the creative process is the use of AI to automate and enhance various stages of artwork creation. Generative AI tools, such as image synthesis and layer separation, have been incorporated to automate the design of backgrounds, terrains, and creatures. For instance, using AI, I was able to separate complex layers such as backgrounds and living entities, creating high-quality individual layers that can be manipulated independently. This allows for intricate and detailed designs that would have been labor-intensive and time-consuming to create manually. Additionally, by utilizing AI-assisted techniques, the project benefits from more fluid and dynamic design processes, enabling faster iteration and creative flexibility.\n\nThis integration of AI does not just streamline the technical aspects of creation, but also augments the artistic process, encouraging unexpected and innovative outcomes. The AI-assisted approach to design also makes it possible to experiment with unconventional styles and combinations, pushing the boundaries of traditional art creation.\n\nThe final artwork can be experienced in various formats, from immersive VR/AR environments to digital art exhibitions. The AI-generated art will also be utilized as educational tools for space exploration and science communication, helping to bridge the gap between the abstract concept of Uranus and the human imagination. Ultimately, this project aims to showcase the power of AI in amplifying creative potential while inspiring awe and wonder about the mysteries of space."

The installation uses generative A.I. to imagine elements of culture and history that are missing. In other words, Kapwa shows us images that feel familiar, but are ultimately false: prosthetic versions of irretrievable lost artifacts.\n\nWhether it’s Thanksgiving dinner in the style of a Norman Rockwell painting or taking a photo in front of Disneyland’s castle in the 90s, the intent with this generative A.I. investigation is to showcase Filipino-Americans throughout the course of the centuries and re-write our poorly documented and poorly preserved presence back into American history.\n\nThere is little preserved documentation of our Philippine indigenous people outside of what the Spanish wrote and drew when they colonized the islands in the 1400s. Often these accounts and observations are tainted by racism and even eugenic undertones. What is often dismissed is the prowess of these several hundred distinct groups, each with their own language, belief system, way of life, and resourcefulness. This generative A.I. content attempts to showcase the variety of people living throughout the archipelago and to connect the audience to these people through visual embodiments of authority, fortitude, confidence, beauty, community, and resilience.\n\nThrough Kapwa we are learning how to collaborate with AI in an authentic and ethical manner, using generative A.I. to imagine elements of culture and history that have been destroyed. We are continuing to work with A.I. models to generate more inclusive imagery of the varied skin tones, hair textures, body types, and face shapes across the global Philippine people.\n\nKapwa is designed for groups of people to have a shared experience with the content. Each screen is motion activated and begins its content once participants step into the activation zone.\n\nAudiences submitted feedback to the installation via a form. \nBelow are some of the collected responses.\n\n“I really appreciated the way the found footage elements segued into the generative AI parts as a nod to the way that current stereotypes are created and compounded through social media.”\n\n“I love the fact that AI was used for a purpose! Some people tend to think that AI is only used as a shortcut.”\n\n“I also really appreciated the way that the aggregated quality of the audio built on the visual parallel.”\n\nThe projections, audio content, and motion activated elements of the project allow for a flexible installation to fit requirements for venues showcasing the project."

Being both a woman and an artist has also deepened their sensitivity to “othered” narratives—those often silenced or marginalized.\n\nThrough a blend of research and lived experience, their work intertwines the personal with the collective, constructing fictional worlds that examine, distort, and question dominant narratives. Drawing from science fiction, mythology, and pop culture, Lee explores the spectrum of dark imagination and hopeful projection, addressing issues such as sexism, racism, and colonialism.\n\nCentral to their practice is an interest in the boundaries between opposing yet complementary forces—yin and yang, tragedy and comedy, good and bad, laughter and crying.

    "workDescEN": "This work is based on urban speculations inspired by the fast developing, fast-paced Shenzhen City in the Greater Bay Area, and more precisely, on a small neighborhood in its Longgang District far North of the center, which is currently undergoing urban development. This neighborhood, changing from farmland to a highly developed urban space in only a few decades, has inspired the artist to produce an art installation that uses an idiosyncratic mixed method involving custom-made sound design, AIGC, 3D modeling and rendering, simulation of the actual city, and a spatial installation setup with CRT monitors to reflect on potential and alternative futures of this neighborhood in a far distant time. The work reflects the relationship between construction noise, mechanical low-tech sound, urban development and so-called “high-tech parks.” The artist team presents a work that lets the viewer perceive a distant future through visual and sonic technologies. The key is that cities are increasingly technological, not only at their core of how they are built, maintained and controlled as “smart cities,” but also in the sense that humans who live, work and travel in cities use screens, earbuds, loudspeakers, cars and so on to navigate, use, and access the environment. This artwork posits that, in turn, these technologies and media change the ways in which humans perceive their surroundings – and AI as a novel form of mediator of existing content plays a crucial role in shaping contemporary human perception of the world."

    "workDescEN": "Humanity has endowed the ever-changing world with the dimension of ‘time,’ yet what remains unchanged is our eternal pursuit of the mysterious and the infinite. Dreaming the Stars transcends the limitations of time and space, blending Eastern mythology, artificial intelligence, and future technology. It narrates humanity's enduring journey to explore the unknown, dreaming of uncovering the secrets of distant stars. Yet, as technology advances, the boundaries between the surreal illusory and the real blur, and the seemingly attainable future causes us to forget the truth of our present existence.\n\nThis work is deeply inspired by André Breton’s surrealist philosophy, intertwining the exploration of dreams and the unconscious with the tangible world, while paying homage to the themes of human evolution and cosmic exploration in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Through virtual production, the project begins with the symbol of the ‘Loong,’ an Eastern mystical icon, introduced within a virtual environment, prompting a profound reflection on human culture. Using AI technologies on platforms such as Runway and ComfyUI, static images from the Dunhuang flying deity murals are transformed into dynamic visuals, allowing past artistic visions to flow within modern mediums, presenting a new language of intertwined time and space.\n\nBy constructing a virtual universe environment with Unreal Engine (UE) and integrating AIGC-generated symbols such as black holes and mandalas, the work explores, through visual metaphors, the deep unity between matter and spirit, technology and myth, reflecting humanity’s evolving process of cognition. The mysteries of black holes and the cosmic order of mandalas become the bridges connecting the real and the surreal, the past and the future, breaking the traditional boundaries of film narrative and creating an immersive surreal art experience.\n\nThis method of transcending the boundaries of the physical and virtual echoes the spirit of ancient Dunhuang cave paintings. Our ancestors projected their limitless imagination of the cosmos onto cave walls, constrained by physical space. Today, virtual production (VP) technology allows modern artists to break free from these spatial limitations and open up endless fields of creation. Dreaming the Stars, aided by AI-assisted creation, expands human artistic vision while driving profound innovation in film narrative and artistic expression. It not only challenges the boundaries between the virtual and the real, the digital and the physical, but also invites the audience into a surreal artistic world, rich with futuristic imagination and philosophical reflection, exploring the infinite connections between humanity, the cosmos, technology, and the soul."

After or even during the trek to spawn, salmon die and leave their bodies to feed wildlife inland, ultimately fertilizing their home forests in one of the few cases on Earth where nutrients flow from the ocean to the land. This cycle throughout millions of years has created the unique landscape of the region, braiding together the lives of countless peoples, inclusive of flora, fungi, and fauna.

    "artist": "袁正\nYuan Zheng",
    "artistIntroCN": "",
    "artistIntroEN": "Yuan Zheng's artistic practice is dedicated to exploring the increasingly blurred boundaries between humanity, technology, and nature, revealing the interplay between human identity and the natural world in the context of technological advancement. He introduces artificial intelligence as a creative tool within the emerging research field of visual arts, delving into the fusion of textile art and fine art practices. By integrating AI-driven design methods, digital visualization, 3D printing techniques, and traditional Chinese embroidery, he has developed a unique and innovative creative process that imbues his work with multiple dimensions of material innovation. His practice transcends the boundaries of craft, art, and artificial intelligence, showcasing not only the possibilities of material experimentation but also addressing crucial topics such as human identity, technological progress, and the climate crisis.\n\nYuan Zheng's core focus lies in flux, processes, materials, and surfaces, inspired by Foucault's concept of the subjective body. Through mixed media installations, he strives to cultivate an attitude of intimacy and engagement. Themes of artificial intelligence and mythology, and the symbiosis between humans and plants, permeate all his works. Humans and the material world are interwoven within an active and complex network, blurring the boundaries between people and matter, fostering dialogue and deepening the understanding of mutual relationships.\n\nYuan Zheng's works envision a multifaceted set of possibilities and connections between living and non-living entities, aiming to explore the potential of artificial materials. He blurs the definition of \"boundaries\" and uses \"objects\" and their derived mappings as conceptual starting points. Beginning with images generated by artificial intelligence, plants, human forms, and spaces are collaged together and reconfigured. Through these processes, Yuan Zheng creates complex, bewildering, and sometimes irrational and subjective structures that span multiple disciplines. By emphasizing the distinctions between imagination and reality, his works re-examine hierarchical and dualistic thinking through the creation of artificial miniature natural simulacra, extending self-awareness into the environment and promoting an understanding of the wholeness and interconnectedness of existence.",

    "workDescCN": "本作品为袁正“未来植物”研究路径中的一项阶段性实践，延续其在人工智能生成生物图像、数字雕塑构建、生态意识及东方植物哲学方面的跨学科探索。作品以AI模拟生成的植物形态为基础，结合3D建模与虚拟展示技术，试图探讨在技术介入条件下，自然形态如何被重构、异化，并在后自然语境中获得新的生命定义。\n\n兰花作为艺术家持续使用的标志性视觉元素，贯穿其多个创作阶段，在本件作品中亦以未来生物的形式重新演绎。兰花既作为自然界中高度复杂的进化结构，也承载着东方植物美学与文化象征意义。在作品中，兰花形态超越其原始物种特征，转化为一种栖居于虚拟生态中的“新自然形象”，体现出艺术家对人类与自然关系的持续思考与再阐释。\n\n本作品采用AR增强现实技术进行展示，观众可在现实环境中与数字生态实体进行动态交互，打破物理空间的展陈边界。这种数字栖居的展演方式强化了艺术家对“后自然”“虚拟物种”与“感知生态”相关议题的关注，也拓展了观众对生态与媒介之间关系的认知方式。\n\n总体而言，作品不仅是一次跨媒介与跨文化的艺术实验，也构成了对当代生态想象、东方自然哲学以及人类—技术—物种关系进行重新定位的阶段性回应。",
    "workDescEN": "This work represents a significant stage in Yuan Zheng’s ongoing research into \"future flora,\" continuing his interdisciplinary investigation into AI-generated biological imagery, digital sculptural systems, ecological consciousness, and Eastern botanical philosophy. Utilising artificially simulated plant forms in combination with 3D modelling and virtual rendering techniques, the work explores how natural morphology is restructured and reimagined under technological mediation, and how definitions of \"life\" and \"ecology\" are evolving in a post-natural context.\n\nAs a recurring visual motif throughout the artist’s practice, the orchid reappears here in a transformed, speculative form. Its presence embodies both the complexity of botanical evolution and the symbolic resonance it holds in Eastern aesthetic traditions. In this work, the orchid transcends its biological origins to become a signifier of a new nature—an imagined lifeform inhabiting virtual ecosystems. Through this, the artist reflects on the increasingly entangled relationship between humans and nature, positioning the orchid not merely as an object of representation, but as a philosophical agent.\n\nThe piece is presented through Augmented Reality (AR), allowing audiences to encounter the work directly within their physical environments. By removing the constraints of traditional exhibition formats, AR enables a hybrid spatial experience in which digital ecology and embodied perception coexist. This exhibition strategy reinforces the artist’s exploration of \"post-nature,\" \"synthetic species,\" and \"perceptual ecologies,\" while also prompting critical reflection on how contemporary media technologies shape our understanding of the natural world.\n\nAs both a cross-media experiment and a conceptual inquiry, the work repositions ecological imagination and Eastern philosophies of nature within digital conditions. It marks a transitional moment in the artist’s broader project: to critically examine the evolving entanglements between technology, species, and human agency through the lens of speculative botanical aesthetics."
